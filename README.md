Arduino based bot with radio control. The challenge we had accepted consisted of 
few reglament instructions. In our project, it was prohibited to use round wheels 
to accelerate the bot. So, our team decided to use tracks instead. We emphasized 
the idea behind the design, which was inspired by the automotive industry. 
You can find out that people living in cold areas, like Sibir, are using some 
special car tracks to navigate through difficult terrain.
